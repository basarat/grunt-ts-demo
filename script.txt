We have a very basic application. 

Debug the typescript in developer tools 
Place a breakpoint at animal 
You can see the call stack 
You can observe variables 

Lets create a new file. 
Lets call it human cause we are animals. And hummans (especially developers) eat pizza.
Now you need to go in and add all these references. 
You index.html 
You main.ts
While all that you wanted was that animal should come before other files and main.ts should come after 
-
Additionally when the signature changes. e.g. lets remove the speak function. It still compiles. 
However its a runtime + compiletime error

It can merge all your files for you as well using the typescript compiler. 

What I would do is that I would have this running in some corner
and it will tell me when I have broken something.

Reference.ts is generated for you.
You can have additional files + comments  in this section as well and they all stick around. 
e.g. Say you want cow to come before all animals. Thats fine. 
Move it outside and now it will not get added inside
